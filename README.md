# IN SEASON - A Bay Area specific seasonal produce guide
For my final project in the Web Design DeCal (WDD) at UC Berkeley, I created a website to help people identify fresh produce at local markets. 
It lists characteristics of different seasonal fruits and veggitables, and provides tips on how to prepare certain produce! <br>
