                                            Growing up as an Asian American, a lot of acts of affection are displayed with food. 
                                            Fruit in particular hold a special place in my heart—from the way my ba ngoai (maternal grandmother) 
                                            makes me dried perssimons from her trees, or the way my dad buys yellow dragonfruit even though they're 
                                            expensive because he knows I like them
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Coming to college I realized I had taken the fresh fruit & vegetables at home for granted. 
                                            I never knew the ‘right time’ to buy certain produce and picking good produce was not a skill that I had
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            After moving into an apartment with my friends, I realized they were just as bad as me if not worse 
                                            (one time I let my friend go grocery shopping by himself and he bought wilted green onions...)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Hopefully this site can help others in similar situations enjoy the taste of fresh produce :)

                                            Ya' know I like to think that I'm not that picky, but I HIGHLY DISLIKE avocados.
                                            I honestly think avocados on toast is a waste of bread and would rather eat durian,
