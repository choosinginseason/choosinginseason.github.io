                                            Growing up as an Asian American, a lot of acts of affection are displayed with food. 
                                            Fruit in particular hold a special place in my heart—from the way my ba ngoai (maternal grandmother) 
                                            makes me dried persimmons from her trees, or the way my dad buys yellow dragon fruit even though they're 
                                            expensive because he knows I like them

                                            Coming to college I realized I had taken the fresh fruit & vegetables at home for granted. 
                                            I never knew the ‘right time’ to buy certain produce and picking good produce was not a skill that I had

                                            After moving into an apartment with my friends, I realized they were just as bad as me if not worse 
                                            (one time I let my friend go grocery shopping by himself and he bought wilted green onions...)

                                            I honestly think avocados on toast is a waste of bread and would rather eat durian,

                                            I actually picked up on a decent amount of how to pick out good produce by going grocery shopping with my parents as a kid, 
                                            but I was still unfamiliar with a lot of things so I asked them when I went home for Thanksgiving haha
                                        </li> 
                                        <li>
                                            As for finding out what was actually in season I had no idea. In most supermarkets they'll still have most fruits and vegetables
                                            stocked even if they're out of season for the region (in this case CA). However, the trade-off is that they tend to be more expensive
                                            and it may be harder to find ripe produce readily available. So for this portion, I heavily refrenced 
                                            <a href="https://sfenvironment.org/vegetables-fruits-in-season-bay-area">Bay Area Seasonal Fruit & Vegetable Guide.</a> 
                                            It has a list of which produce are in season in Bay Area farmers markets which I thought would be nice for people who like to buy locally.

                                            Currently, this is not fully extensive site with ALL of the produce available in Bay Area markets. Due to the time constraints I decided to 
                                            restrict it to seasonal items and exclude anything that could be bought year round.

                                        <li>
                                            Then to narrow it down I just choose what I liked to eat since I would be spending time to create the image library :')
